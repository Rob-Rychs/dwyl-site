## How?

## Technology

**Hosted on GitHub Pages**

**Functional CSS with Tachyons :heart:**

To learn how we used function css to power our website hop over to [learn-tachyons](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tachyons).

**Serverless forms via Google scripts**

The contact and app beta sign up forms were built without a back-end using [this helpful guide](https://github.com/dwyl/html-form-send-email-via-google-script-without-server).
