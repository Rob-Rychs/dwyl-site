## How?

To run this site on your localhost, simply ***install*** the *dependencies* from npm and then ***start*** it:

```
npm install && npm start
```

Then visit: http://localhost:8181

Starting live-server will automatically open your default browser.

To run the redesign tests do:

```
npm run test:dev
```

## What?

This new version of the dwyl site will reflect our [PETE stack](https://github.com/dwyl/technology-stack/) and freshen up the site with a design refresh.
